    <h1>Common Gateway Interface (CGI)</h1>
    <p>
    Check out <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875">RFC 3875</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      CGI is basically a convention for binding HTTP servers to client processing
      scripts/applications. The HTTP server worries about receiving and responding
      to the client, wheras the CGI script worries about processing the request:

      <ul>
        <li>dealing with permissions</li>
        <li>accessing documents</li>
        <li>processing data</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
      </ul>

      Perl CGIs were all the rage back in the 90s. It's how the web took off. Today,
      PHP is a very common choice for writing CGI scripts.

    <h2>The Crux</h2>
    <p>
      You can write CGI scripts in any language you want, so long as you can run
      your app from the command line given a few constraints. The flow works like this:

      <ol>
        <li>Web server receives a request for some resource</li>
        <li>
          Web server recognizes that some or all of the path points to a CGI script
          based on how the web server is configured
        </li>
        <li>
          Web server executes this script by giving it the CGI meta-variables,
          sending the message body through your scripts STDIN, and reading the response
          from your STDOUT.
        </li>
        <li>Web server then delivers the response to the client after some possible post-processing</li>
      </ol>

      Your script should expect these things:
      <ol>
        <li>
          HTTP headers and request meta-information will be delivered as environment variables (system-dependent).
          Ex. <code>REQUEST_METHOD</code>, <code>HTTP_HOST</code>, <code>PATH_INFO</code>, etc.
        </li>

        <li>The message body will be sent to STDIN</li>
        <li>Your response, with special response header formatting will be written to STDOUT</li>
      </ol>

      Most languages have a framework or two already built that make this easy for you.
